OTSDesignPatternLecture
=======================

Lecture on design Patterns given for Open Tech school (during Hackership)


# What is this about?

This is the source code of a Latex Beamer presentation.

This presentation introduces design patterns, possibly in a language agnostic way, 
examples being however delivered as actual code.
The intended audience is junior/intermediate developers. 


# How to compile?

Compiling will require Latex (tested with TexLive 2014, A.K.A. pdfTeX 3.1415926-2.6-1.40.14),
and includes minted.sty a package to highlight source code. This package is based on pygments
and thefore requires pygmentize to be in the path (http://pygments.org/docs/cmdline/)
